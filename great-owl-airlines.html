<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
India’s aviation sector is expanding rapidly, yet Jaipur remains underserved internationally.
This project evaluates whether a new airline — <strong>Great Owl Airlines</strong> — could
successfully operate from Jaipur between 2026–2027.
</p>

<h2>2. Market Understanding</h2>
<p>
I analysed Jaipur’s catchment area, mapped passenger flows, and assessed competition from Delhi.
Despite strong demand drivers, Jaipur lacks sufficient international connectivity.
</p>

<h2>3. Forecasting Demand — Gravity + Time-Series</h2>
<p><strong>Gravity Model demand estimate:</strong> 10,434 – 72,237 annual passengers</p>
<p>
<strong>Time-Series Forecast:</strong> New route introduction improves total traffic stability 
and trend strength.
</p>

<h2>4. Airline Simulation Results</h2>
<p>
Using Airline Online, Great Owl Airlines grew to 13 international destinations. Asian routes 
performed strongly, while London underperformed.
</p>

<h2>5. Financial Performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>2026 Profit: <strong>$10.9M</strong></li>
<li>2027 Loss: <strong>$16M</strong> (maintenance + advertising overspend)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Final Recommendation</h2>
<p>
The airline is viable with conditions: right-size aircraft, prioritise strong Asian markets,
improve maintenance scheduling, and tighten cost control.
