    <h2>1. Project Background — Why Jaipur?</h2>
    <p>
      When I began this project, one question guided my entire research:
      <strong>“Can Jaipur realistically support a new airline with sustainable international operations?”</strong>
      <br><br>
      India’s aviation market is growing aggressively, yet Jaipur—despite being a major tourism and business hub—
      remains overshadowed by Delhi.
      <br><br>
      This gap presented the perfect analytical challenge:
      <strong>Could a new carrier, Great Owl Airlines, capture untapped demand and operate profitably from Jaipur?</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Market Understanding — Looking Beyond Raw Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      My first step was to understand <strong>who actually flies from Jaipur</strong> and, more importantly,
      <strong>who doesn’t</strong>.
      <br><br>
      I mapped the entire catchment area, analysing:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Population distribution</li>
      <li>Tourism flows</li>
      <li>Corporate travel demand</li>
      <li>Income levels and aviation propensity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A recurring pattern emerged — <strong>high-value passengers were leaking to Delhi.</strong>
      <br><br>
      This indicated something crucial:
      <strong>The demand existed — but Jaipur’s supply didn’t.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Forecasting Demand — Gravity + Time-Series</h2>
    <p>
      A single forecasting method is often misleading, so I combined:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gravity Model</strong> — structural demand estimation</li>
      <li><strong>Time-Series Forecasting</strong> — trend + stability analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Gravity Model suggested <strong>10,434–72,237 annual passengers</strong>.
      <br><br>
      Time-series showed that adding new international routes
      <strong>stabilised Jaipur’s overall passenger trend</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Airline Simulation — Building Great Owl Airlines</h2>
    <p>
      Using Airline Online, I simulated Great Owl Airlines with a fleet tailored to Jaipur.
      <br><br>
      Over two simulated years, the airline expanded to <strong>13 international destinations</strong>
      — with Asian routes outperforming:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Dubai</li>
      <li>Singapore</li>
      <li>Bangkok</li>
      <li>Kuala Lumpur</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The London route underperformed, highlighting the need for <strong>right-sized aircraft and cost control</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Financial Performance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2026 Profit: $10.9M</strong> — strong load factors + efficient scheduling</li>
      <li><strong>2027 Loss: $16M</strong> — maintenance mis-timing + high advertising spend</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Final Recommendation</h2>
    <p>
      The airline is <strong>viable</strong> with the right strategy:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Focus on Asian short–medium haul markets</li>
      <li>Use right-sized aircraft</li>
      <li>Improve MRO scheduling</li>
      <li>Targeted digital marketing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ultimately, Great Owl Airlines has a strong opportunity to become
      <strong>Jaipur’s international gateway to Asia.</strong>
