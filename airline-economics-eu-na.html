<h2>2. Objective</h2>
<p>
To analyse whether the EU–NA market became more or less concentrated over time, using airline market 
shares, alliance dominance, and HHI.
</p>

<h2>3. Methodology</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Market share analysis</li>
    <li>Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI)</li>
    <li>Alliance vs independent carrier comparison</li>
    <li>COVID-19 distortion analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Market Structure Findings</h2>
<p>
The analysis shows that alliances maintained strong dominance, with HHI indicating a 
moderately concentrated oligopoly.
</p>

<h2>5. COVID-19 Impact</h2>
<p>
HHI spiked sharply during the pandemic, reflecting temporary dominance by a few carriers due 
to market contraction.
</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The EU–NA market is moderately concentrated, recovering competitiveness after COVID while 
remaining structurally alliance-driven.
